## Who am I?
My name is Israel, born and raised in Monterrey, MÃ©xico, currently, more and more Chicago based. I studied Engineering in Software Development back in 2007, worked as an intern for a couple of years, before focusing mostly on my own IT Business for over 10 years!

## Why a blog?
_Why not...?_  
Jk, I'm not sure really, I guess it all started when I began reading [Dev.to](https://dev.to). I realized that writing for the sake of writing is ok, and if I can help anyone out with what I'm writing, even better.
Afterward, I read [Sara Soueidan's](https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan) [**Just Write**](https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/) article and I felt that I should definitely create my own blog.
Also, I love googling about a new technology stack or library and finding amazing how-tos, guides, and tutorials online, which I invariably read, regardless if I'll actually use the library, so I guess I decided to also pay back some of that amazing content with some made by myself.

## What will I be writing about?
Mostly, WebDev stuff. I've had different roles through the years, mostly Project Management and Business Analyst but since late 2017 I've gotten back into writing code myself, focusing on both backend and frontend.
I've also worked on Education, and my current startup is helping Mexican schools get up-to-date with their Computer Science curriculum, so some stuff about schools as well.
And last but not least, entrepreneurship. I've been involved in a number of startups throughout the years. Some have flunked badly, some are alive and well, so I guess I have some insight into that as well.

## Why is 42 the answer to life... the universe... everything?
Regardless of what many people claim, Douglas Adams once claimed in a quite nonchalant way in an interview:  
_"The answer to this is very simple,"_ Adams said. _"It was a joke. It had to be a number, an ordinary, smallish number, and I chose that one. Binary representations, base 13, Tibetan monks are all complete nonsense. I sat on my desk, stared into the garden and thought 42 will do. I typed it out. End of story."_  
So much for all the crazy hypothesis.

## Closure
So there's that! My first few articles will all be WebDev related, with the first one being a little something about the JAMstack, Netlify, and Nuxt.js, which are the backbone of this blog.

So thanks for reading and see you soon!
